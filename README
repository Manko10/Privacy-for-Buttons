So why Privacy for Buttons?
===========================
There are several reasons why you should use Privacy for Buttons:

 * It's secure:
   Privacy for Buttons only runs on your own server. Therefore no third-party
   tracking of your users is possible.
   Because of this approach you also don't have problems with SSL secured websites.
   The original social media buttons often don't play well with encrypted connections.
 * It's fast:
   Unless you use the Iframe Web API, Privacy for Buttons only requests third party
   websites on server-side, no client-side requests have to be done. Additionally,
   all these requests are cached on the server for a specified amount of time.
   But also if you use the Web API, most buttons create fewer requests than
   their originals.
 * It's small:
   Not only does Privacy for Buttons reduce the number of requests, it also
   reduces the amount of data being transferred. Many buttons are about half the size
   of the original ones. This also speeds up connections and gives your visitors
   a better user experience.
 * It's flexible:
   Privacy for Buttons is designed to be easily extensible. Besides a Web and
   server-side API for all bundled buttons, you can also extend this
   application with your own set of buttons without having to modify any existing
   code. Just write the additional classes and put them in place. They will be
   hooked in automatically.


Usage:
======
Privacy for Buttons let's you either include the buttons via Web API for use in
Iframes or via a server-side PHP API. It's your own decision, which method you
prefer, but if you have the technical knowledge, we advise you to use the latter
since it reduces your bandwidth usage and makes the site faster for your visitors.

Usage of Privacy for Buttons is relatively simple. First of all make sure, the
web server can write to the 'Cache' directory. In this directory all HTTP
requests done by the application are cached.

For use of the Web API, call the front controller by specifying the button
command name. For example:

http://www.example.com/privacyforbuttons/?c=Tweetbutton&url=http://...

This would call the Tweet button, provided that the public application path is
'/privacyforbuttons/'. Several buttons might require more parameters. E.g. the
Tweet button also requires and 'url' parameter, which specifies the URL you want
the button to create for. More parameters are possible for further customization.
For more details about parameters and how to use particular buttons, read their
documentation.

For the server-side PHP API include 'API/SocialMediaButtons.php' and create a new
instance of 'Pfb_API_SocialMediaButtons'.
This will return a button factory instance, which you can use to create your button.
E.g. to create a Tweet button for <http://www.example.com/> run

$tweetButton = $buttonFactory->getButton('TweetButton', 'http://www.example.com/');

Now to get the actual button code call $tweetButton->getButtonCode(). This will
return the HTML code for this button. $tweetButton->getButtonCSS() will return
the default CSS for it. Note that you need to set the PUBLIC application path
first if you use the default CSS. You can to this by calling:

Pfb_Config::setConfig('publicApplicationPath', '/public/application/path');

The public application path is the path, which the user sees in his browser's
address bar.
You can customize your Tweet button by setting further parameters with
$tweetButton->setParam(). For more details about this, read the documentation of
the particular button.

More than one button on a page is possible, also with different configuration.
Only make sure you don't include the CSS more than once.

Global application configuration is done in 'config.php'. However, to alter the
configuration, DON'T modify this file. It will be overwritten with the next update.
Instead create a file config.local.php and write your configuration there.
This will override the default settings.
